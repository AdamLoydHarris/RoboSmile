Repo for the RoboSmile team's MEXA mental health AI hackathon project. We want to use large language models to help patients communicate their mental state clearly and with minimal distress in the early stages of treatment.

Update from Adam

I've used gemini to help me make an app with flask. This has absolutely no functionality.

Clone the repo, make a conda env using env.yaml, make sure youre in the right directory with conda env loaded, type 'python app.py' in terminal
